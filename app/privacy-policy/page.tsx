              Kinimi Private Limited operates a global online platform under the name Hiffi, designed to support and promote artists, with a particular focus on live streaming performances, uploading pre-recorded content, and enabling real-time audience interaction. The Platform allows artists to monetize their work through voluntary support payments, tips, and subscriptions from audiences worldwide. We facilitate secure payment processing, deduct a platform service fee, and disburse the remaining amount to the respective artist. In doing so, we process certain personal information from both artists and audience members in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
