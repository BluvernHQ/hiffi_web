                Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and shall take place in Delaware. Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs, with arbitration fees split equally unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                You agree that arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action, collective action, or representative action. You waive the right to participate in class actions or collective proceedings.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The following matters are excluded from arbitration and may be brought in court:

                Notwithstanding the arbitration provision, Kinimi Corporation may seek injunctive relief in court for any violation of these Terms or to prevent irreparable harm.
